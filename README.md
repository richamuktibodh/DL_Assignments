# DL_Assignments
A collection of assignments done for the course Deep Learning @IIITD

## Assignment 1
Created a custom dataloader using Pytorch for the MNIST dataset

Implemented a feedforward neural network using torch.nn.Linear and used ReLU and Sigmoid as the activation function

Implemented a feedforward neural network and backpropagation from scratch using only tensor operations. Used ReLU and Sigmoid as the activation functions

## Assignment 2
Used [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset for images and [SpeechCommands](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands) dataset for audio. 

Implemented ResNet, VGG and Inception architectures from scratch for image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset and audio classification on SpeechCommands dataset

## [Assignment 3](A3)
Implemented Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders and Conditional Variational Autoencoders from scratch using Pytorch. 

The encoder and decoder architectures were based on ResNet.
