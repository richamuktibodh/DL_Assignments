A collection of assignments done for the course Deep Learning @IIITD

## Assignment 1
Created a custom dataloader using Pytorch for the MNIST dataset

Implemented a feedforward neural network using torch.nn.Linear and used ReLU and Sigmoid as the activation function

Implemented a feedforward neural network and backpropagation from scratch using only tensor operations. Used ReLU and Sigmoid as the activation functions
